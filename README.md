Data Scraping with Selenium and Visualization with Power BI
This project involves the collection of data using the web scraping technology Selenium and its visualization through Power BI. The goal of the project is to understand customer behavior and analyze sales trends.

Project Objective
To gather product data from web pages using Selenium and subsequently visualize this data in Power BI. The visual presentation of the analysis results facilitates the decision-making process.

Technologies Used
Selenium: For web scraping.
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations.
Data
The project utilizes product data collected from various web pages. However, the limited amount of data negatively impacts the quality of the models built. This reduces the reliability of the results and hinders the accurate analysis of customer behavior.

Results
The scarcity of data diminishes the effectiveness and accuracy of the model. Additionally, there is a need to implement further strategies to gather more data.

Usage
After downloading the files, you can run the scraping code in a Python environment to collect the data. Then, you can open the collected data in Power BI to visualize your analysis.
